# 🧺 Laundry Wallah

Laundry Wallah is my first HTML project — created as part of my learning journey in web development.

## 📖 About the Project
This project was built using only **HTML**. It was my first assignment, where I learned to structure a web page using headings, paragraphs, images, links, and basic layout elements.

## 🧱 Features
- Simple static webpage built with HTML  
- Basic layout with text and images  
- Demonstrates understanding of HTML tags and structure  

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to create and organize HTML elements  
- Adding headings, paragraphs, and images  
- Creating links and lists  
- Structuring content for a clean layout  

## 🚀 Future Improvements
In future versions, I plan to:
- Add **CSS styling** for better design  
- Include **JavaScript** for interactivity
